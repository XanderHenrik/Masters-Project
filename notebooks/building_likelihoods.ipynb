    "# A trial of [firecrown](https://firecrown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_static/intro_article.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we explore firecrown. A software package that allows us to build likelihoods based on a certain cosmological model defined by a set of parameters $\\{\\theta_{cosm}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebooks, we have investigated the matter power spectrum, angular power spectra and a basic, cutting-corners calculation of the sensitivity to neutrino parameters. The knowledge acquired in these will now be put to use. The elements that we investigated before will now serve as ingrdients to building a \"likelihood\". This in turn is an important ingredient for the Bayesian inference of the cosmologiical parameters through a statistical frameworks. (It provides DESC tools that are consistent and build up good results.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Firecrown allows you to use the obtained likelihood for:\n",
    "- cosmoSIS\n",
    "- Cobaya\n",
    "- NumCosmo\n",
    "of which we will be using cosmoSIS later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main objects are:\n",
    "- Cosmological model (parameters) [through [CCL](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05995)]\n",
    "    CCL allows us to calculate any (theoretical) cosmological quantity. These wuantities are also essential to the likelihood but are calculated by CCL rather than firecrown.\n",
    "- Modelling tools (haloprofile, perturbation theory, etc.)\n",
    "    Firecrown provides a set of modelling tools that will be available next to CCL and will be updated to the \"current cosmology\". These modelling tools allow for additional analysis, like perturbaurion theory, haloprofiles, etc. Modelling tools link the cosmology to theoretical models that can be used to obtain the likelihod. Effectively this ensures that all different elements that go into the calculation of the likelihood are based on the same cosmology.\n",
    "- Likelihoods\n",
    "Typically, firecrown builds \"Gaussian family\" likelihoods, where the likelihood can be expressed as the distance between the expected and observed quantity of some observable. This Gaussian family of likelihoods take the form:\n",
    "$$P(\\vec{x}| \\vec{\\mu}, \\~M) = f(\\chi^{2})$$\n",
    "$$\\chi^{2} = \\sum_{i, j}(x_{i} - mu_{i})^{T} M_{i, j} (x_{j} - mu_{j})$$\n",
    "with:\n",
    "$$\\~M = \\~C^{-1}$$\n",
    "where **$\\vec{\\mu}_{i}$** is the theory vector, **$M_{i, j}$** the inverse of the covariance matrix $\\left(\\~C\\right)$ and **$\\vec{x}_{i}$** the datavector.\n",
    "\n",
    "To initialize firecrown and obtain such a likelihood, we use a SACC file (Save All Correlations and Covariances). It is through the info in this SACC file that firecrown builds a likelihood that is written to be sampled by the statistical framework specified in the SACC file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For building a Gaussian distribution, we require a datavector, a covariance matrix and a theory vector. Both the data vector and the covcariance matrix are passed through the SACC file. For the theory vector, firecrown gives the possibility to create a *statistic array*, which utilizes CCL. The statisic array can be generated by specifying certain *sources* to build correlations for example. Ohterwise, one cab also refer to the available statistic arrays within firecrown. The statistic array then calls upon the CCL objects and functions that can generate the theory vector.\n",
    "The given sources will specify the statistic that is used as a theory vector for the generation of the likelihood. A Source references the underlying 'pyccl.Tracers' from CCL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firecrown also contains *systematics*. A systematic can be used to alter the theory vector by changing a certain aspect of the theory specifics, such as a shift in the galaxy distribution, etc.\n",
