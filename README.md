# Master thesis project

This repository contains the numerical part to the research. Its main functions is to house the final built-up forecasting analysis, provide version control and collect all "progress" in one place.

The research is part of my master thesis project, for the masters programme Theoretical Physics (TP) at Utrecht Universoty in Utrecht, The Netherlands.
The first year consisted of following courses, starting in september 2023. With a planning that considered half a year of extra studying, I started my master research project in february 2025. At the start of the thesis project, I had finished all my courses which allowed me to search for a thesis project abroad and leading me to this project. I now perform my research at the Oskar Klein Centre in Stockholm, which will extend to the end of january 2026.

The conceptual title(s) of the research is:
"6x2pt + Cross-correlations with CMB Lensing for Stage-IV Neutrino mass constraints"
"Forecasting neutrino mass constraints from cross-correlations between LSST photometric and Planck CMB observations"

In short:
With the upcoming surveys of Vera Rubin (LSST) in mind, we will extend the existing 3x2pt. analysis (LSST/DESC Project 314) of cosmological observations by including cross-correlations with CMB lensing (the 3rd comsological probe, which we introduce to the analysis). Because of the neutrino sensitivity of the CMB in multiple stages of the Universe, this allows for better neutrino mass constraints from the Stage-IV survey. We will be working on building up a forecasting pipeline, that analyses the cross-correlations of these observations to extract the potential neutrino mass contraints for future experiments.
As an ideal result, we deliver a fully working pipeline that will forecast the extended analysis in the framework of the next generation surveys.
